## Intro

In this quick project, I have analyzed some climate change data using shell. I have used some simple programs, including awk or sed to do the needed cleaning and the calculations.

## Data

The dataset used is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data), and it is owned by Berkeley Earth. Its license is CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. This is an interesting dataset which gives tons of relevant information on climate change. 

## Conclusions

The output folder contains all the outputs given for the different methods used. 
We see how, in general, the series used is complete from 1753. A decade-to-decade study gives the chilling perspective of a mean increase of 0.8º C the last 4 decades. However, we should consider some measuring error. 
This analysis can be an example on how Shell can be an interesting tool for a quick processing of csv files.

## Other

Please note that since this work only aimed at developing some tasks that would normally be done in pandas or R, a very deep analysis can’t be found here. This is only an exploration of the potential of shell tools for a quick analysis.
